          As the world scrambles to address the mounting urgency of climate change, Nickel Asia Corp. (NAC) is proving that even in the gritty world of mining, a greener future is within reach.The company has broken new ground — literally and figuratively — by completing an inventory of its carbon emissions related to land use change. NAC is the first company with mining assets in the Philippines to pull this off. This monumental achievement isn’t just a gold star for the company; it’s a shining beacon for others to follow. For NAC, this bold move marks a milestone in its ambitious quest to achieve its Net Zero Carbon objective by 2050. They also bring biodiversity back to areas impacted by mining through extensive reforestation efforts.
