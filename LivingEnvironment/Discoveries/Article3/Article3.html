          Researchers from the Institute of Human Genetics led by Dr. Eva Maria C. Cutiongco Dela Paz, executive director of the UP Manila National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the Collaborative Center for X-Linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (CCXDP) and the Philippine Genome Center are conducting a research project to determine the epidemiology of X-Linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) also known as “Lubag Syndrome.” The project aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the prevalence of the genetic cause of XDP. Although genetic studies indicate that XDP most likely represents a founder mutation within the Panay Islands population, the actual frequency of this mutation and how widely individuals who carry it are distributed throughout the Philippines remain unknown.
