        <strong>Study Title:</strong> Complete mtDNA Genomes of Filipino Ethnolinguistic Groups explores mitochondrial DNA to understand genetic diversity and migration patterns of Filipino ethnolinguistic groups, highlighting heredity and ancient lineages.

      <p>
        The study explores the genetic history and migration of Filipino ethnic groups by analyzing mitochondrial DNA passed down from mothers.

      <p>The Philippines is a strategic point in the Asia-Pacific region for the study of human diversity, history and origins, as it is a cross-road for human migrations and consequently exhibits enormous ethnolinguistic diversity. Following on a previous in-depth study of Y-chromosome variation, here we provide new insights into the maternal genetic history of Filipino ethnolinguistic groups by surveying complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes from a total of 14 groups (11 groups in this study and 3 groups previously published) including previously published mtDNA hypervariable segment (HVS) data from Filipino regional center groups.<br>
         Comparison of HVS data indicate genetic differences between ethnolinguistic and regional center groups. 
         The complete mtDNA genomes of 14 ethnolinguistic groups reveal genetic aspects consistent with the Y-chromosome, namely:
          diversity and heterogeneity of groups, no support for a simple dichotomy between Negrito and non-Negrito groups,
           and different genetic affinities with Asia-Pacific groups that are both ancient and recent.
           <br> Although some mtDNA haplogroups can be associated with the Austronesian expansion, there are others that associate with South Asia,
            Near Oceania and Australia that are consistent with a southern migration route for ethnolinguistic group ancestors into the Asia-Pacific, with a timeline that overlaps with the initial colonization of the Asia-Pacific region,
             the initial colonization of the Philippines and a possible separate post-colonization migration into the Philippine archipelago.
