        Article: Techno-economic data and assumptions for open energy modelling of decarbonisation pathways in the Philippines introduces an openly accessible dataset to support energy system modeling for decarbonization in the Philippines. It includes data on power plants, electricity demand projections, and renewable energy potentials (e.g., solar, wind, tidal).

      <p>This article introduces an openly accessible dataset aimed at supporting energy system modelling of decarbonisation pathways in the Philippines. The dataset was compiled through an extensive literature review, incorporating information from various sources such as the Philippines Department of Energy, academic publications, and international organisations. To ensure compatibility with OSeMOSYS modelling requirements, the data underwent processing and standardisation. It includes power plant data covering existing capacity from classified by grid, off-grid, and planned additions, as well as historical generation data. Additionally, the dataset provides historical and projected electricity demand from 2015 to 2050 segmented by sectors. It also offers technical potential estimates for fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, along with key techno-economic parameters for emerging technologies like floating solar PV, in-stream tidal, and offshore wind. The dataset is freely available on Zenodo, empowering researchers, policymakers, and private-sector actors to conduct independent energy modelling and analyses aligned with the U4RIA framework principles. Its open access encourages collaboration and facilitates informed decision-making to advance a sustainable energy future not only for the Philippines but also for broader global contexts.</p>
