      <h2>Key Insights:</h2>
      <p>
        A process for identifying Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) for the Philippines was undertaken in two phases. The 128 terrestrial and freshwater KBAs were identified in 2006 and the 123 marine KBAs were identified in 2009. A total of 228 KBAs resulted from the integration of the terrestrial, freshwater and marine KBAs. These KBAs represent the known habitat of 855 globally important species of plants, corals, mollusks, elasmobranchs, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals in the country. The inclusion of these KBAs in the countryâ€™s protected area system will be a significant step towards ensuring the conservation of the full scope of the country's natural heritage.
