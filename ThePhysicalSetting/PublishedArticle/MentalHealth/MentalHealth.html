        According to the articles of Newport Institute entitled <em>'How Does Your Physical Environment Affect You and Your Mental Health?'</em>, in its paragraph that shows how physical environment affects us based on the research, they cited that view of nature and light can help in the fast recovery and healing of a person after an operation, as well as, it plays an important role in both physical and mental health. Insufficient light can cause damage in our brain and can trigger stress, anxiety, and depression. Based on the neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania, rats that were kept in the dark for six weeks showed depressive behavior and damage in the area of the brain that produces norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, the neurotransmitters involved in emotion. On the contrary, too much light at night can disrupt sleep and mood.
