          Surface?</strong

          Geographical Sciences (2010)</em
        >, human activity affects the changes of the Earth's surface. It affects
        the Earth's natural processes. The climate is caused by human activity,
        erosion that has various causes, both natural and man-made, degradation,
        and habitat loss. Human activity played a part in modifying the surface
        of the Earth by interfering with the natural processes that can
        sometimes lead to bad effects.
