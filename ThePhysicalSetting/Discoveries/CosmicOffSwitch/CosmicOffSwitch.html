          According to published articles by Paul Sutter on the Live Science
          website, particularly one entitled "Could the universe ever stop
          expanding? New theory proposes a cosmic 'off switch'", scientists are
          now exploring the possibility that the universe’s expansion might not
          be eternal. The mysterious force known as Dark Energy—which drives
          the accelerated expansion of the cosmos—could potentially undergo
          what researchers call “violent transitions.” These sudden changes in
          state may act as a kind of cosmic "off switch," reversing the
          universe’s growth and possibly leading to a contraction phase. This
          new theory opens up profound questions about the ultimate fate of the
          universe and challenges long-held assumptions about its future
          trajectory.
