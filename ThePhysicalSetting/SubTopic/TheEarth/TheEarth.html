              It is the third planet from the sun that is spherical in shape. It
              is mostly made of rock, a relatively thin layer of water that
              covers almost three-fourths of it, and is enveloped by a thin
              blanket of air.

              It is the only planet that supports life. The gravitational pull
              of the planet's mass is enough to hold onto an atmosphere that
              evolved because of the physical conditions on the Earth's surface,
              the evolution of plant life, and it is an integral part of the
              global ecosystem.

            <p>
              The distance of Earth and the Sun ensures that the Earth can have
              enough energy to sustain life and not so fast that it can quickly
              boil away water and the necessary molecules that may cause life
              would not form.
            </p>
            <p>
              The one-year revolution of the Earth around the Sun results in the
              seasonal variations of climate, the rotation of the Earth on its
              axis for 24 hours produces the night-and-day cycle, and the
              combination of Earth's motion and the moon's orbit around the
              Earth once in 28 days produces the phases of the moon.
