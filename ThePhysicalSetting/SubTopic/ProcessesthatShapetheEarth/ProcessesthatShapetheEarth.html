              The continual changes occurring in the surface of the Earth are
              caused by the forces within it. As the separate crustal plates
              move above the hot, almost molten or softer layer, an inch or more
              per year, some of it sliding past each other, convergent or
              colliding, and moving away. When the crustal plates converge or
              collide it creates mountain ranges, when one plate slides on
              another and sinks it also creates mountains because of the
              Earthquake that breaks the surface, and volcanic eruptions that
              release molten rock from below, when it moves away from each other
              under the continent it will create a valley, and when it occurs in
              ocean basins it will also widen the ocean floor. When volcanic
              eruptions happen in the mid-ocean it may create islands and
              mountains higher than mountains in land.

              Waves, wind, and ice also play a role in sculpting the Earth's
              surface. The waves eroded the shoreline by carrying sediments and
              breaking the rocks, as well as the glacial ice that deposits the
              sediments that it carries to the sea, and the wind carries off
              loose surface materials and deposits or transfers it elsewhere.

              The elements such as carbon, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen change
              the location and the chemical compositions of land, ocean, and
              atmosphere as it cycles in and on it. The minerals are made,
              dissolved, and remade again on the surface and buried beneath the
              surface. Solid rocks are formed by the shells of dead organisms
              and sand that is buried and solidified by the dissolved minerals.
              The sedimentary rock is also buried enough and undergoes the
              process of melting and crystallization because of the heat and
              pressure, and it forms other types of rock. As this cycle
              continues it creates another surface and sometimes mountain.

              Plants, animals, humans and other organisms also shaped the Earth
              by changing the soil's composition and texture, altering the
              atmospheres, and also increasing the emissions of carbon dioxide
              that increase the temperature of the Earth.
