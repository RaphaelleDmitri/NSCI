              Based on the modern theory of matter, elements consist of
              different tiny particles called atoms that join together in a
              different configuration to create new substances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each atom is composed of a positive charge (protons) nucleus at
              the center, and it is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.
              It also contains a neutral charge called neutron, that is added to
              its mass but does not affect the number of electrons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matter can exist in different states such as solid, liquid, and
              gas. The state of matter is affected by the temperature and
              pressure. If the temperature is cooler, atoms or molecules packed
              together in solid state. If the temperature increases the energy
              also increases, as well as, the motion of an atom that enables
              them to slide past each other like in the liquid state. When the
              temperature increases more the attraction becomes lesser that
              enables them to move freely, as it is in gas.
