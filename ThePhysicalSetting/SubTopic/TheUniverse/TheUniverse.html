              Earth only existed for about one third of the history of the
              universe. Our universe contains billions of galaxies including the
              Milky Way Galaxy, which is the galaxy where Earth is located. The
              Milky Way Galaxy is an ordinary disk-shaped galaxy that consists
              of billions of stars. Near the edge of the galaxy, there is an
              orbiting medium-sized star, which is the sun.

              Using the fastest rocket, it will take a thousand years to reach
              the star near the sun, four years for the light of the nearest
              star to reach the Earth, and it will take not long after the
              beginning of the universe for the light of the nearest galaxy to
              reach us.

              It came from an explosion of a single dot of a hot, dense, and
              chaotic mass more than ten billion years ago. The stars are formed
              from dense clouds of gases made by the lightest elements, which
              are hydrogen and helium. It will continue to heat up and begin
              releasing nuclear energy from the fusion of lighter elements to
              heavier elements in its core. After some time, it will explode
              which also affects the celestial bodies near it, and it will again
              create a cloud of gas and continue the cycle of star formation.

              Our solar system also came from the clouds of gas from the wake of
              the exploded stars about 5 billion years ago. Everything in and on
              Earth is made of these elements. The heavier elements fall at the
              center of the planets, while the lightest elements were mostly
              blown or boiled away from the sun (for the planets near the sun,
              such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars), and surround the planets,
              such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, as deep
              atmosphere of gas or frozen solid layer.

              There is a star that is smaller or bigger, and cooler and hotter
              than the sun, but they are part of a system of two or more stars
              orbiting around a common center of mass. There are also other
              galaxies that are different in size, shape and the direction of
              motion. Despite these differences, the elements, forces, and forms
              of energy are the same to our solar system and galaxy. They also
              behave according to physical principles.
