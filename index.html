      <p>The word “science” probably brings to mind many different pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats and microscopes, an astronomer peering through a telescope, <br>a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein’s equations scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling beaker.<br> All of those images reflect some aspect of science. But none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets: <br><br>Based on dictionary, science can be defined as:<br> Science can also be defined as our knowledge of the natural world and the process through which that knowledge is built. <br>The process of science relies on the testing of ideas with evidence gathered from the natural world.<br> Science as a whole cannot be precisely defined but can be broadly described by a set of key characteristics.</p>
